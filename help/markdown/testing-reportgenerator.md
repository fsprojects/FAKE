# Fake.Testing.ReportGenerator

ReportGenerator converts XML reports generated by OpenCover, PartCover, dotCover, Visual Studio, NCover or Cobertura into human readable reports in various formats.

he reports do not only show the coverage quota, but also include the source code and visualize which lines have been covered.

ReportGenerator supports merging several reports into one. It is also possible to pass one XML file containing several reports to ReportGenerator (e.g. a build log file).

```fsharp
"#r "paket:
nuget Fake.Core.Target

Target.create "Generate Reports" (fun _ ->
   let parameters p = { p with TargetDir = "c:/reports/" }
   !! "**/opencover.xml"
   |> ReportGenerator.generateReports parameters
 )

Target.create "Default" DoNothing
