/// Native support for Azure DevOps (previously VSTS) / Team Foundation Server specific APIs.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The general documentation on how to use CI server integration can be found <a href="/guide/buildserver.html">here</a>.
/// This module does not provide any special APIs please use FAKE APIs and they should integrate into this CI server.
/// If some integration is not working as expected or you have features you would like to use directly please open an issue.
/// <br/><br/>Secret Variables:
/// <br/>This CI server supports the concept of secret variables and uses the <a href="/articles/core-vault.html">Vault</a> to store them.
/// In order to access secret variables you need to use one of the fake 5 tasks from
/// <a href="https://github.com/isaacabraham/vsts-fsharp">vsts-fsharp</a>.
/// <br/>
/// <br/>
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// Example implementation (supports runner and vault tasks)
/// <code lang="fsharp">
///        // Either use a local vault filled by the 'FAKE_VAULT_VARIABLES' environment variable
///        // or fall back to the build process if none is given
///        let vault =
///            match Vault.fromFakeEnvironmentOrNone() with
///            | Some v -> v // fake 5 vault task, uses 'FAKE_VAULT_VARIABLES' by default
///            | None -> TeamFoundation.variables // fake 5 runner task
///
///        // Only needed if you want to fallback to 'normal' environment variables (locally for example)
///        let getVarOrDefault name =
///            match vault.TryGet name with
///            | Some v -> v
///            | None -> Environment.environVarOrFail name
///        Target.create "Deploy" (fun _ ->
