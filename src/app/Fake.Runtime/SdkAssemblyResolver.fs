/// here we will pin Fake runner execution framework to .NET 6 as in `SdkVersion`
/// We will also try to resolve the current SDK that the runner is executing, if it is the same as pinned
/// one then we will use runtime assemblies from that SDK version on its installation on disk. Otherwise,
/// we will default to NetStandard2.0 assemblies. We will download them since they are packaged in a NuGet
/// package extract them a and reference them.
/// the resolution of runtime version for the selected SDK is as follows; we will use the dotnet official release
/// package to get the releases for pinned framework version, and get the runtime. If the accessing the network
/// is not possible, then we will use a cached releases file.
